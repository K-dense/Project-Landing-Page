# Project-Landing-Page
The Odin Project's Landing Page Project

This project is going to be a very simple landing page.
The design was provided by The Odin Project and it's meant to test my knowledge on Html and Css.
This project will help me cement my knowledge on navigating the Terminal as well as a refresher on basic HTML and CSS concepts.

The Design I have to imitate can be found here:

Just as before, I'm expected to create/open/delete files and directories using the terminal and nothing more.

Let the fun begin!
